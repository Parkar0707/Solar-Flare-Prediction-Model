# Solar-Flare-Prediction-Model

<h2>Solar Flare Prediction with LSTM Neural Network</h2>

A time-series model using LSTM to predict solar flare flux values based on real-time solar X-ray flux data from NOAA's GOES satellites.

This project aims to predict solar flare activity by analyzing solar X-ray flux data collected by NOAA's GOES satellites. Solar flares can disrupt communication systems, satellites, and power grids on Earth, making accurate prediction essential for mitigating potential damage. Using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, this model processes recent flux measurements to forecast future solar activity.
